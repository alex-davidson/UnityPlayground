Objective: a flock simulation where the flock members chase and consume food placed by the player.

Progress:
 * Terrain
 * Camera motion in the world XZ axis with 'conventional' mouselook
 * Food placement
 * Animals
 * Animals chasing food
 * Animals maintaining distance from each other
 * Flocking (partial)
 
Remaining:
 * Strength of flocking 'instinct' based on when they were last fed
